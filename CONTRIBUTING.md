## Setup Guide

DiaryVault is written in Flutter. Even though Flutter is cross-platform, DiaryVault is currently focused on Android. So in order to setup and run the project locally, you need to have an Android emulator or a real device.

Running the project is as simple as:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/SankethBK/diaryvault

$ flutter pub get

$ flutter run
```
