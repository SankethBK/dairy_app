### Motivation for building this app

As someone who enjoys writing in a diary, I've tried out many diary apps on Google Play.
Through my own experiences and by reading what others have shared in their reviews, I've gained a better understanding of the issues that current diary apps face.

* Requires premium subscription for seemingly simple features
* Lack of proper authentication: In some cases, users have to enter their password every time they log in, as there is no support for fingerprint authentication
* Ads are the last thing you want to encounter while writing; just picture yourself composing a thought-provoking entry, and an ad suddenly appears, disrupting your train of thought
* No support for images
* No automatic saving: People don't want to lose their lengthy notes just because they ran out of battery, received a phone call or clicked on a notification
* No font customization for overall app and individual note level
* No customizable sorting: Not everyone wants to sort by date
